# UofTHacksXI Project: Tu-Pac

Imagine piecing together your own memories and unlocking a brand new story while playing a timeless old-fashioned game... That's "Tu-Pac"! A revolutionary gaming experience where nostalgia meets innovation.

## About the project

Tu-Pac is a Retro-Gamified Photo Album version of Pac-Man. For this project, we used Python, PyGame, Cohere API and an Object Detection Model.

## How it works

**Goal: Collect three full photos to complete the full narrative**

* Users begin with the iconic Pac-Man game interface
* The App will get 3 pictures from user's photo gallery
* Each picture is evenly split into 4 pieces and are randomly placed in the maze
* As you navigate the maze, you encounter and collect photos pieces (4)
* Each photo piece comes with a line of a new narrative, revealing the story as you collect them
* The complete picture will be assembled along with the narrative upon successfully collecting all the photo puzzles
